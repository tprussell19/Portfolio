  <h1>About me</h1>
  <div class="background">
    <p>
      I was born and raised in <strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>. After graduating from Lincoln High School, I played a year of Division III baseball at <a href="https//:www.pacificu.edu">Pacific University</a> in <strong>Forest Grove, OR</strong>. A few years (and schools) later, I graduated from <a href="https:www.pdx.edu">Portland State</a> with a degree in Communication Studies.

      While going to school back home in Portland, I began coaching baseball at my alma mater and discovered a passion for coaching/teaching. I turned that passion into my first job after graduation working as a Special Eduaction Paraeducator. It was an incredibly rewarding experience to be part of a team that ensured that special education students received a more equitable and inclusive high school education. After five years as a para and nine years coaching baseball, I was ready for a new challenge. That is how I found myself at Epicodus.
