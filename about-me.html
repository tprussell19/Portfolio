      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in <span class="important">Portland, Oregon</span>. After graduating from Lincoln High School, I played a year of Division III baseball at <a href="https//:www.pacificu.edu">Pacific University</a> in <span class="important">Forest Grove, OR</span>. A few years (and schools) later, I graduated from <a href="https:www.pdx.edu">Portland State</a> with a degree in Communication Studies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While going to school back home in <span class="important">Portland</span>, I began coaching baseball at my alma mater and discovered a passion for coaching/teaching. I turned that passion into my first job after graduation working as a Special Eduaction Paraeducator. It was an incredibly rewarding experience to be part of a team that ensured that special education students received a more equitable and inclusive high school education. After five years as a para and nine years coaching baseball, I was ready for a new challenge. That is how I now find myself as a student at <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>.

        I currently live in <span class="important">SE Portland</span> with my fiance and our two cats and two dogs.

      <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
      <p>
        Most of my hobbies and interests are sports-related. I really enjoy staying physically active through playing sports. I don't love just working out or just running so being on a basketball or softball team or having a race to train for really helps me stay in shape. That has been significantly more difficult during the pandemic, unfortunately. On the bright side, while working from home I had much more time and energy to take my dogs on long walks around the neighborhood. 
      </p> 
      <p>
        I also love attending live sporting events. I have season tickets to the <span class="important">Portland Thorns</span> and am a huge women's soccer fan in general. I was lucky enough to be able to travel to <span class="important">France</span> for the <span class="important">2019 Women's World Cup</span>. It was absolutely incredible. I love going to <span class="important">Portland Timbers</span> games as well and try to get to as many games as I can during a season. My first sporting love though was the <span class="important">Portland Trail Blazers</span>. I remember going to games as a young kid at the Memorial Colliseum before the Rose Garden was built.
